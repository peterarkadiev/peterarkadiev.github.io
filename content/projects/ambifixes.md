My DFG project at the University of Potsdam (2024-2027).

<!--more-->

This is a project on the morphological typology of ambifixes (affixes that can occur both as prefixes and as suffixes),
which I started together with Yury Lander back in 2020 (see Arkadiev & Lander 2020, 2021, 2022 below). I am now able to
continue working on it in a really serious way thanks to the financial support of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) 
and the hospitality of the [Potsdam Typology Lab](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/de/slavische-linguistik/posla-typology-lab)

## General Abstract

The main objective of the project is to study ambifixes in the languages of the world. Ambifixes are affixes 
(grammatical morphemes) that, depending on certain conditions, can occur both before and after the root. 
An example of ambifix is the Lithuanian verbal reflexive morpheme “si”, which occurs word-finally if the verb 
does not contain any prefixes (*rodo-**si*** ‘it seems’) or immediately before the root if the verb contains 
a prefix (*ne-**si**-rodo* ‘it does not seem’). Ambifixes occur in a number of languages across the globe, 
including some of the European languages, but they have never been systematically studied. The project will 
explore ambifixes from two different perspectives. The first perspective is typological. It aims at creating 
a comprehensive catalogue of ambifixes from many diverse languages belonging to different language families 
and spoken in different areas, and at classifying ambifixes along a number of parameters. The most important 
of these parameters concerns the factors that determine whether a given ambifix occurs before or after the root. 
These factors include the phonology of the root or word (for example whether it starts with a consonant or a vowel), 
its morphological make-up (for example, whether it contains a prefix or not), the word’s lexical class (for example, 
whether it is a noun or an adjective), its grammatical properties (for example, whether the verb is in the present 
or in the past tense), and potentially some others. The second perspective is diachronic or historical. 
It aims at discovering and investigating the types of grammatical elements and constructions that ambifixes 
can arise from, the pathways of change by which they develop, and, among other things, to try to understand 
why ambifixes are rather infrequent in the languages of the world. This project is important for linguistics 
because it aims to study an intriguing morphological phenomenon that has not received enough attention so far 
and whose detailed investigation can throw new light on the kinds of morphological structures found in the 
world’s languages, on the rules that organise these morphological structures and relate them to other 
levels of language, and on the mechanisms and pathways of language change.
