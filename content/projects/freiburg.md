My FRIAS project (2023-2024).

<!--more-->

This is the research project on wide-scale morphosyntactic typology which I had started back in 2009 (see e.g. [this talk](https://peterarkadiev.github.io/talks/Arkadiev2010_case_n_headmarking_leipzig.pdf)) and pursued intermittently till 2012, after which I had to leave it aside for the lack of time. My fellowship at the Freiburg Institute for Advanced Studies (November 2023 - August 2024) allows me to resume this work.

## General Abstract


The project aims at investigating cross-linguistic diversity in the domain of interaction between the two main morphological argument-coding systems found in human languages, flagging (case marking) and indexing (verbal agreement/cross-reference). More particularly, the goal of the project is to establish a typology of argument-flagging systems in languages possessing highly-developed head-marking with a focus on how the two systems of argument encoding are distributed and interact with each other, and to try to uncover functional and, where possible, diachronic motivations for the observed types of such interactions. The project will involve a construction of a database comprising ca. 300 languages from diverse language families and linguistic areas, as well as of a genealogically stratified sample based on this database in order to conduct quantitative analysis. The research questions addressed in the project include those not covered in the typological literature, e.g. patterns of matching vs. mismatching between flagging and indexing, the extent and motivation of double-marking of different argument roles, possibility of indexing of peripheral participants etc. I believe that a broad empirical investigation of the cross-linguistic variation in this domain will not only contribute to the better understanding of the workings and development of human language, but will also be potentially beneficial for interdisciplinary studies involving sophisticated linguistic data.
